# COSC-4353-Group-A

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/AnotherSkyBoi/COSC-4353-Group-A.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/AnotherSkyBoi/COSC-4353-Group-A)

This project will read in txt files which represent collections of graphs that are given as either adjacency matrices or adjacency lists, along with related metadata. The program will convert this txt file into a CollectionOfGraphs object that contains a list or array of Graph objects which itself will have strings representing metadata as well as two pandas dataframes: one for the graph represented as an adjacency lists, one for the graph represented as an adjacency matrix. Furthermore, this project will define member functions for each Graph object that allow low level transformations (inserting nodes, deleting nodes, inserting edges, deleting edges).
